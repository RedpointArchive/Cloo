Cloo
========================

Cloo provides bindings to OpenCL from C#.

**IMPORTANT: We are no longer maintaining this library.**

This library has been removed as a dependency from Protogame as of Dec 24th 2016.  Since there are a wide range of compute-based APIs in addition to OpenCL (such as CUDA and DirectCompute), we believe any future work in this area should be integrated directly into MonoGame, which is already responsible for other platform and hardware abstractions.

This repository will remain available and in it's existing state for any older versions of Protogame in use.
